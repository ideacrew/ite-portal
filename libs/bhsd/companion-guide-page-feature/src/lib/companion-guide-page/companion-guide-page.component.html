  The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) Integrated Technology Engine (ITE)
  Provider Behavioral Health Supplemental Data (BHSD) Companion Guide (the
  Guide), also known as Provider Gateway BHSD Submission Instructions, is issued
  by IdeaCrew, on behalf of DBH to provide DBH&rsquo;s certified behavioral
  health (BH) providers with detailed instructions on the BHSD reporting
  guidelines and data validation rules. The Guide is intended to be a reference
  for DBH staff and DBH-certified BH service providers, including consultants or
  contractors, who are involved in BHSD collection, extraction, coding,
  submission and/or monitoring.
</p>
<p>
  The federal reporting requirements specified in the
  <a href="#bookmark0"
    >Combined Substance Use and Mental Health Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS)
    State Instruction Manual with Data Submission System (DSS) Guide Version
    4.3.1</a
  >1 are heavily considered in defining the requirements for the
  District&rsquo;s BHSD, although they are not the same as the BHSD
  requirements.
</p>
<p>
  The Guide is subject to periodic updates, to be consistent and compliant with
  federal and DBH policies and protocols. Any updates in the Guide will be
  documented in the version log. Any changes requiring providers to update data
  tracking practices or querying logic for BHSD submission will be notified to
  providers up to 90 days, to the extent possible, before the effective date.

            will have a unique data field description and the field name. The
            data field name has no space but often has an underscore (_) and is
            always spelled in lower case. For example, the data field name of
            Client ID is client_id. The header of a BHSD dataset must use the
            field name whereas this document will use the data field description
            for clear communication. In the Guide, every word of a data field
            description is capitalized in blue (e.g., Admission Date orDischarge
            Reason)

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ol>
      <li data-list-text="2.1">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          In November 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
          approved the District of Columbia (the District) Section 1115 Medicaid
          Behavioral Health (BH) Transformation Demonstration waiver (Section
          1115) with an effective date of January 1, 2020. The demonstration
          allows the District&rsquo;s Medicaid program to pay for services
          provided to adults with Serious Mental Illness (SMI)/Serious Emotional
          disturbance (SED) or substance use disorder (SUD) residing in an
          institution for mental disease (IMD). The waiver approval ensures that
          Medicaid provides a broader continuum of BH services and a
          person-centered system of physical and behavioral health care for the
          District residents through integrated and coordinated treatment
          services.
        </p>
        <p>
          In April 2022, CMS further approved a State Plan Amendment (SPA) to
          allow the District to transition its Section 1115 services for Mental
          Health Rehabilitative Services (MHRS) and Adult Substance Use
          Rehabilitative Services (ASURS) to permanent State Plan authority and
          expand the range and the availability of BH services covered by
          managed care contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the initial approval of the Section 1115 waiver, a range of
          behavioral health services have already been carved into Medicaid
          managed care contracts. Many of the MHRS and SUD providers have
          already been submitting applicable claims to the Medicaid Managed Care
          Organizations (MCOs). Effective October 2023, the transition to the
          carve-in model will be complete as a full continuum of BH services
          will be incorporated into managed care plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the District&rsquo;s behavioral healthcare authority, during and
          after this transition, the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH)
          continues to be responsible for federal reporting, BH provider
          certification, and managing locally funded services. Furthermore, DBH
          is shifting its focus to supporting whole-person care (WPC) service
          delivery, outcome-based care, and population health. This is a sea
          change in the entire BH service community in the District. DBH needs
          accurate and reliable data to support behavioral health clients during
          and after this transformation, to monitor the quality of services and
          outcomes, and to meet federal reporting requirements. Consequently,
          DBH-certified providers must regularly submit Behavioral Health
          Supplemental Data (BHSD), the provider extract, to DBH as described in
          this guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, most DBH-certified mental health (MH) providers utilize the
          iCAMS electronic health records (EHR) system, and all DBH-certified
          SUD providers use the DATA WITS (WITS) EHR system. This arrangement
          allows DBH to extract data necessary for federal reporting from iCAMS
          and WITS. The District&rsquo;s Medicaid reform will require each
          provider to transition away from using iCAMS and WITS and
          independently manage and communicate BH clients&rsquo; EHR information
          directly with MCOs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Effective October 1, 2023, DBH will no longer require DBH-certified MH
          and SUD providers to use iCAMS and WITS. All DBH-certified providers
          must submit BHSD via the Provider Gateway (the Gateway) as instructed
          in this Guide. DBH encourages providers to begin to prepare for the
          transition immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Providers who have successfully tested the submission of BHSD from
          their own EHR systems via the Gateway will be allowed to exit iCAMS or
          WITS before October 1, 2023.

    <h4>What is BHSD?</h4>
    <p>
      The Behavioral Health Supplemental Data (BHSD) is client-level information
      about BH services and supports provided by a DBH-certified provider to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          District residents who are eligible for or enrolled in Medicaid, the
          Alliance and Immigrant Children&rsquo;s Program (ICP); and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          District residents who do not qualify for Medicaid, the Alliance or
          ICP but who receive BH services or support under emergent
          circumstances.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Currently, BHSD includes eighty-six (86) data fields in the following
      domains:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li data-list-text="1.">
        <p>Client demographic information</p>

  <li data-list-text="2.3">
    <h4>Who should submit BHSD?</h4>
    <p>
      DBH-certified MH and SUD providers must submit BHSD as guided in this
      document upon securing its EHR and exiting iCAMS and/or WITS. A
      DBH-certified provider must ensure that BHSD includes data for all
      services rendered to the client regardless of payor source and communicate
      all service encounters and claims for clients covered by managed care
      directly with MCOs.
    </p>
    <p>
      All District residents are eligible to receive Crisis Services,
      Stabilization Services, and Involuntary Treatment Services regardless of
      income and Medicaid/Alliance/ICP enrollment status. Thus, all services
      rendered to the District residents by DBH-certified crisis services
      providers must be reported to DBH through the Gateway.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text="2.4">
    <h4>Purpose and Intended Use of BHSD</h4>
    <p>DBH will collect and use BHSD for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>To comply with federal and District laws and regulations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To comply with grant reporting requirements, including but not limited
          to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
          Administration&rsquo;s (SAMHSA) Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS),
          National Outcome Measures (NOMS), and Uniform Reporting System (URS)
          reporting requirements, to ensure continued funding.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To assist with financial activities, including budget development and
          grant management,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To certify MHRS and SUD providers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To support quality management and utilization management activities.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To monitor BH clients&rsquo; outcomes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To understand the BH well-being and service needs of the
          District&rsquo;s residents and identify any service gaps in the
          community.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The compiled BHSD will be part of the Integrated Technology Engine (ITE)
      solution, linking BH client and service information submitted by providers
      with Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) claim data, managed care encounter
      data, and other District-funded or grant-funded program data. The results
      of integrated data will be used for the purposes identified above.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>ITE </strong>is a <em>technological </em>solution aligned with
      DBH&rsquo;s business <em>process </em>that will consolidate accurate and
      timely behavioral health data enabling DBH managers and staff (<em
        >people) </em
      >to make informed decisions toward the District&rsquo;s vision of
      population health and whole-person care. BHSD will be submitted and
      processed via the Gateway, a component of ITE.

    <h4>Federal Reporting Requirements</h4>
    <p>
      The collected BHSD will be used to ensure compliance with the following
      SAMHSA data reporting requirements:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li data-list-text="a)">
        <p>
          Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) provides client-level data about
          drug use patterns among clients receiving SUD treatment, including
          primary drug use, age at first use, mode of administration, and
          frequency of use. This data is used to track changing patterns of drug
          use and treatment need. Client discharge data in TEDS is used to
          analyze the treatment length of stay and treatment completion for
          treatment outcome studies.

          MH-TEDS/MH-CLD (Client-Level Data) is client-level mental health data
          about admission and updates/discharges for clients treated in
          facilities that receive state funds. These data fields were previously
          collected to support the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant
          and Substance Abuse and Prevention Treatment Block Grant Application
          Guidance and Instruction. MH- TEDS/CLD includes data fields about
          mental health admissions, treatment, demographic, socioeconomic,
          legal, clinical, and outcome data of clients receiving services from
          DBH-certified providers. MH-CLD contains one record for each person
          served, whereas MH-TEDS contains one record for each admission to, and

        <h4>Treatment Episode (Service Episode or Episode)</h4>
        <p>
          A treatment episode, also referred to as a service episode or an
          episode, forms the basis of BHSD reporting. It&rsquo;s defined as the
          period of contact, with specified dates of beginning (admission) and
          end (discharge), between a client and a treatment provider or team of
          providers. A treatment episode starts with an Admission Date and ends
          with a Discharge Date. A treatment episode that has no Discharge Date
          by the end of BHSD reporting period is considered an open episode
          where the client continues to receive active treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
          A single Episode has only one primary treatment setting (and a
          principal drug of concern for SUD client) and no non-planned absence
          of contact for greater than three (3) months. Refer to below
          definitions of &ldquo;admission&rdquo; and &ldquo;discharge.&rdquo;

          <li data-list-text="3.2.1">
            <p>Admission</p>
            <p>
              For SUD services, admission is defined as the formal acceptance of
              a client into SUD treatment. An admission has occurred only if the
              client begins SUD treatment. Events such as initial screening,
              referral, and wait-listing for substance use treatment are
              considered to take place before admission to treatment and should
              not be reported as admissions for the BHSD reporting.
            </p>
            <p>
              For MH services, admission is the start of any type of MH
              treatment services rendered to a client, including those who
              received an MH evaluation, screening or assessment, through a
              program operated or funded by DBH, Medicaid and public funds.

            <p>Admission Type: Initial Admission vs. Transfer Admission</p>
            <p>
              Admission can be either an initial admission to a treatment
              setting or a transfer admission (also referred to as a transfer)
              to another treatment setting. A transfer admission can be:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  from one treatment setting (level of care) to another within a
                  single episode of treatment with the same provider;
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  from one treatment setting to another within the same provider
                  network; or
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  from one facility to another to receive short-term care, such
                  as medical care.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not every billable service (e.g., group therapy, individual
                  therapy, etc.) is considered an admission. If these services
                  were delivered within a single treatment setting (e.g.,
                  outpatient), count only one of these records as an episode.

                    inpatient hospitalization to a community-based outpatient
                    program) or a change from an SUD service to an MH service,
                    or vice versa, is considered a transfer. A transfer to a new
                    treatment setting is considered an admission resulting in a
                    new separate episode record and its record type should be
                    reported as a transfer admission. Initial admission and
                    transfer admission records for MH services should be coded
                    differently from those for SUD services. (Refer to </a

            <p>Discharge</p>
            <p>
              A discharge is defined as the end (or termination) of treatment
              services in a particular setting and/or with a particular service
              provider. When a client is transferred to another treatment
              setting or another service provider and continues to receive the
              treatment without a service gap, the client is considered
              discharged from the existing episode and a new episode will start.
            </p>
            <p>
              Services may be terminated for many reasons: treatment program
              completion, transfer to another treatment setting, client
              drop-out, facility termination, or the client&rsquo;s inability to
              continue treatment because of death, incarceration, or other life
              circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the example below, the same client had three different
              treatment episodes between July 2018 and June 2019. The first
              episode began on July 7, 2018, when the client was initially
              admitted to a community mental health clinic (CMHC), receiving
              counseling and family therapy sessions as an outpatient. This
              episode ended on November 18, 2018, when the client was
              transferred to a psychiatric hospital. This transfer admission
              became the start of the second episode, which ended on March 3,
              2019, when the client was discharged from the hospital and got
              transferred to a CMHC. This transfer resulted in the third
              episode, which ended on June 16, 2019.

        <h4>BHSD Submission Universe</h4>
        <p>
          A BHSD dataset should include all treatment episodes served during the
          reporting period, including episodes that started or ended during the
          reporting period and those remaining open at the end of the reporting
          period.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a provider submits BHSD for the month of December 2022
          in a CSV format via the Gateway, the file should include:
        </p>
        <ol>

        <p>
          In the example above, records falling in scenario 3 or 4 must have
          been included in the November 2022 submission in addition to the
          December 2022 submission. Likewise, records of scenario 2 or 4 will be
          included in the January 2023 submission following the December 2022
          submission. Episodes crossing multiple reporting periods should have
          their information updated in each reporting period. This will allow
          information about a client remaining in a long-term treatment to be
          regularly updated and reported to DBH.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the client information may be collected at admission only and
          others may be collected at discharge only. Some information may be
          updated throughout the treatment episode. In fact, SAMHSA requires
          states to report the discharge information separately from the
          admission information. States are also required to report open
          episodes with no discharge date at the end of the reporting period as
          update records.
        </p>
        <p>
          BHSD considers these requirements by associating certain data fields
          with admission vs. discharge. However, many data fields will have no
          distinction. Instead, the information submitted for the admission
          reporting period will be considered admission data, whereas the
          information submitted for the discharge reporting period will be
          regarded as discharge data. For an episode that started and ended
          during the
        </p>
        <p>
          same reporting period (i.e., scenario 1 above), the information
          submitted will be considered applicable to both admission and
          discharge. For an open episode admitted in a previous reporting period
          (i.e., scenario 4 above), the submitted information will be treated as
          updated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same framework applies to submissions made via automated
          Application Programming Interface (API) services.

      <li data-list-text="3.4">
        <h4>MH Episodes vs. SUD Episodes</h4>
        <p>
          The BHSD requires both MH and SUD treatment records to be reported in
          a single format. Therefore, all providers, regardless of the treatment
          setting, are required to have the same reporting responsibilities for
          all BHSD data fields. However, certain data fields (e.g., Substance
          Use) may apply to SUD treatment records only, and others (e.g.,
          SMI/SED) may apply to MH treatment records only. Therefore, data
          fields applicable to SUD records will only be allowed to be skipped or
          marked as Not Applicable for MH records, and vice versa. Most data
          fields are pertinent to both treatment settings, and providers are
          encouraged to monitor and report clients&rsquo; co-occurring
          conditions whenever possible, regardless of the treatment setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The District&rsquo;s BHSD is designed to promote whole-person care
          (WPC) and integrated services, from screening, assessment, and
          diagnosis to treatment services, regardless of whether the client
          presents MH problems or SUD problems. It is the best practice and the
          District&rsquo;s vision to serve the whole person for the best health
          outcomes, irrespective of the immediate reason for admission to a
          specific treatment program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the simplified framework will reduce the reporting
          burden among providers by requiring them to submit one single dataset
          per reporting period in a standardized format.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text="3.5">
        <h4>BHSD Submission and Resubmission Requirements</h4>
        <p>
          Upon processing the submitted BHSD, the Gateway will validate each
          data field and each record. The validation results will be available
          and viewable via authorized access to the Gateway. Providers will then
          take corrective actions for any erroneous data in the source of the
          error, including their EHR systems or coding, and resubmit the entire
          dataset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Providers must submit BHSD no less than monthly within ten (10)
          calendar days from the last day of the reporting period. Providers
          must resubmit the entire BHSD dataset after taking corrective actions
          if the initial submission includes any failed records. Until a
          resubmission file is free of failed records, the provider will be
          considered non-compliant with the BHSD submission requirement for the
          respective reporting period.
        </p>
        <p>
          These standards apply to all DBH-certified providers regardless of
          their specialized service type and data submission method. DBH
          reserves the right to amend the reporting frequency and timeline. DBH
          will notify providers of any changes to the submission and
          resubmission policy ninety (90) calendar days before the effective
          date.

          or a database. In BHSD, a combination of key fields will identify a
          unique episode record, which is also a unit for federal reporting. The
          key fields link the same treatment episode across multiple datasets.
          Thus, each record must have valid values for all key fields.
          Otherwise, the record cannot be recognized as a valid record.
        </p>
        <p>
          BHSD has seven key fields: Client ID, Collateral, Admission Date,
          Record Type, Treatment Setting, Discharge Date, and Date of Last
          Contact or Data Update. The Discharge Date will be defined as a key
          field and will fail the entire record if it has an invalid value when
          it&rsquo;s present. However, it will be assumed that an active episode
          that has not ended will not have any value in the Discharge Date
          field. A Null value in Discharge Date will not trigger an error unless
          other conditional fields indicate that the service episode may have
          ended.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text="3.6.2">
        <p>Required Field</p>
        <p>
          A required field is a field that is necessary for a provider to submit
          a valid value. Collecting and reporting data in these required fields
          are necessary for DBH to ensure compliance with federal reporting
          requirements and to monitor the service quality and client outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the data fields in this category may be compared with data
          submitted by other providers or other systems so DBH can monitor the
          data integrity and perform crosswalk analysis for the same clients.
          Missing or invalid values in the required fields will affect the data
          quality significantly and will make the respective record fail to be
          processed as valid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples of required fields include but are not limited to First Name,
          Last Name, DOB, Gender, Race, Ethnicity, Discharge Reason, Living
          Arrangement, Education, Martial Status, Employment, Number of Arrests
          Prior to Admission, Primary SU, Primary SU/MH Diagnosis, SMI/SED
          Status.

        <p>Optional Field</p>
        <p>
          Providers are not required to report data for optional fields but are
          strongly encouraged to collect or prepare to collect in the near
          future. Valid data collected in these fields will be helpful for both
          the federal government and the District to understand better the
          population and services rendered by the behavioral health care
          providers, contributing to improving the policy and shaping the best
          practice models. In addition, some of the currently optional fields
          may become required in the future as the federal guidelines or the
          District&rsquo;s policy changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Missing or invalid values in the optional fields will affect the data
          quality but will not fail the record or prevent processing. The
          Gateway validates data provided in these optional fields, and DBH will
          monitor the data quality of these data fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples of optional fields include but are not limited to Service

    <h4>Data Validation Framework</h4>
    <p>
      Upon receiving the submitted dataset from a provider, the Gateway runs a
      data validation process to identify any errors for each data element, such
      as missing value, invalid value, or data inconsistency. The Gateway
      displays the error category (reason), a message describing the reason in
      detail, and the error type (severity) determined according to the type of
      the data field (i.e., key field, required field or optional field). The
      error type determines whether the respective record is passed as a valid
      record or not. Any record that did not pass needs to be corrected and
      resubmitted.

          A Fail record has (a) fatal or critical error(s) in one or more key
          fields or required fields. A record with (a) fatal or critical
          error(s) is not considered valid. The provider must review all fatal
          and critical errors associated with a Fail record and take necessary
          corrective actions to resubmit the entire data fields of those
          records. A Fail record may also have warnings associated with (an)
          optional field(s), and those data fields with warnings should also be
          reviewed and corrected for resubmission whenever possible.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text="3.7.4">
        <p>Correction of Errors and Resubmission</p>
        <p>
          The Gateway does not allow direct editing or updating records on the
          user interface. Any records with failures or warnings must be
          corrected in the Provider&rsquo;s source system (i.e., EHR) or
          queries/coding that constructed the BHSD dataset. A new submission
          dataset must be generated and uploaded with the corrections.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that a provider may have to make multiple submissions for a
          particular reporting period. Any submission with failed records will
          remain available for review in the Gateway but will not be processed
          as a valid BHSD submission dataset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each new submission must have a complete dataset that includes all
          episodes for the given reporting period. A resubmission file cannot be
          a subset that includes only previously failed records.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a provider has one hundred (100) episode records for a
          given period, and the initial submission had fatal or critical errors
          in ten (10) records, a subsequent submission dataset with corrections
          must contain all one hundred (100) records that were included in the
          initial submission unless the initial submission contained invalid
          episodes.

          episode when multiple datasets are linked. A record with a missing
          value in any of these key fields will result in a critical error and
          the record will fail to be processed as a valid record. One exception
          is applied to the Discharge Date field, which cannot be filled until
          the episode ends. When a Discharge Date is present, however, any
          errors associated with the field will result in a critical error.

              care for individuals with substance use problems and report the
              results in this data field. The below chart displays the
              corresponding ASAM level of care for each treatment setting. If
              the provider&rsquo;s system has only ASAM level of care or
              classifies differently, the provider should map each value with
              the acceptable codes for the BHSD dataset below.

            <p>
              Some EHR systems may have multiple episodes linked with one
              admission. If the definition of admission in your EHR system is
              the same as the definition of admission in BHSD, report a unique
              identifier for the admission record in this field. If the
              definition of an episode in your EHR system is the same as the
              definition of admission in BHSD, report a unique identifier for
              the episode as Admission ID. If neither admission nor episode
              defined in your EHR system is the same as the definition of an
              admission in BHSD, or your system doesn&rsquo;t have a
              system-generated unique identifier, you may skip this field.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              This information must be collected at admission and separately at
              discharge. For data reported at admission, the reference period is
              30 days prior to admission. For data reported at discharge, the
              reference period is 30 days prior to discharge.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If the Admission Date and Discharge Date are close together and
              the reference periods overlap, arrests falling in the overlap
              should be counted as occurring in the 30 days prior to admission.
              They should not be counted again in the 30 days prior to
              update/discharge. For example: if the date of admission is
              February 1 and the date of discharge is February 9, arrests that
              happened on January 13 and 25 should be reported at time of
              admission. They should not be reported again at the time of
              discharge because the 30-day timeframe overlapped between the two
              data reporting periods. Any arrest incidents that happened during
              the time gap between admission and discharge should be reported as
              arrest 30 days prior to discharge. The succeeding figure (Figure
              XX) illustrates this example.

          The District of Columbia has eight (8) wards, each of which has an
          equitable population, determining elections and distribution of public
          services. It is recommended the providers serving primarily the
          District&rsquo;s residents collect or identify the ward information of
          their clients, determined based on the address, whenever possible.

          For an MH client, the principal diagnosis providing the reason for the

        <p>
          ICD-10 codes ranging from F01 through F99 indicate mental, behavioral
          and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, SUD diagnostic codes,
          ranging between F10 and F19, are reported in the SUD Diagnosis fields,
          and they should not be included in MH Diagnosis Fields. Additionally,
          G codes may be used for mental health clients with a problem related
          to the nervous system, and Z codes may be used to describe additional
          factors influencing health status or when the symptoms do not point to
          a specific disorder but still warrant evaluation or treatment. In
          summary, a valid MH code in these fields will begin with F0, between
          F2 and F9, G or Z.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Reporting a value in the first MH Diagnostic Code field is required
          for both MH and SUD records regardless of the presence of an active MH
          diagnosis. An MH client, or an SUD client with a co- occurring MH
          disorder should have a valid MH diagnosis. An SUD client with no
          active MH diagnosis should be reported as 999.9996 (No MH Diagnosis).

      <li>
        <p>

          Reporting a value in the SUD Diagnosis One field is required for both

          must have a valid SUD diagnostic code reported. An MH episode with no
          active SUD diagnosis should be reported as 999.9996 (No Applicable
          Diagnosis) in SUD Diagnosis One field and SUD Diagnosis Two and SUD
          Diagnosis Three fields can remain Null.

              Each Substance Use field (primary, secondary, or tertiary) has
              associated fields: Route of Administration, Frequency of Use at
              Admission, Frequency of Use at Discharge, Age at First Use, and
              Detailed Drug Code. The primary Substance Use code corresponds to
              the primary codes in the other fields, the secondary code to the
              secondary, and the tertiary to the tertiary.

          <li>
            <p>
              The Detailed Drug Code is optional and is used to provide more
              detailed descriptions of the substances reported.

            <p>
              For an SUD treatment record or an MH treatment record with a
              co-occurring SUD, the substance use information, along with a
              substance use diagnosis, should be collected at admission with the
              related variable Frequency of Use at Admission. Additionally,
              Frequency of Use at Discharge for same substance should be
              collected to assess change and needs to be reported to BHSD.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>

              A record should not have duplicate Substance Use codes with
              identical Rout of Administration unless the Detailed Drug Codes
              are different. For example, if the primary and the primary and
              secondary Substance Use codes are both 13 (Benzodiazepines), the
              primary and secondary Routes of Administration cannot be both 1
              (Oral).

    <h4>Connecting to Provider Gateway</h4>
    <p>
      The Gateway publishes secure Internet resources that a provider may access
      to exchange BHSD information, including an API endpoint (for
      system-to-system BHSD submission) and a web portal (for manual upload of
      BHSD submission and review of all prior submitted data). Under the
      onboarding process, DBH and the provider exchanges technical contacts,
      network details and other information necessary to establish secure
      communication. Based on this information, DBH will configure networks;
      establish service accounts and credentials; and exchange keys with
      providers to enable connectivity to Gateway resources.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text="5.2">
    <h4>Encryption</h4>
    <p>
      A multi-level approach is used to protect sensitive data exchanged via the
      Gateway. Transport Level Security (TLS) will secure HTTPS endpoint
      connections at the application level. Additionally, public key encryption
      will enable DBH and providers to control when, by whom, and under what
      circumstances data is decrypted
    </p>
    <p>
      DBH and providers will exchange public keys as part of the onboarding
      process. Prior to each transmission, originators will encrypt the data
      content using the receiver&rsquo;s public key signed by the sender&rsquo;s
      private key.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text="5.3">
    <h4>BHSD Submission using API</h4>
    <p>
      The secure endpoint for API submission of BHSD will be available to
      providers intending to submit BHSD using API.
    </p>
    <p>
      A provider&rsquo;s system must be authorized and certified to submit data
      to the Gateway endpoint. Once this process is complete, a provider&rsquo;s
      system may continue to submit BHSD as required unless or until the
      provider&rsquo;s system or network configuration (IP address) changes
      materially.

      A provider representative must be authorized by the provider and DBH will
      provide the authorized users with credentials to access this portal. The
      portal will provide access to the authorized representatives only and the
      login information will be communicated to the authorized individual
      following the authorization process.

        >Once a representative user has logged in to the Gateway, the user will
        be able to submit a prepared CSV BHSD file in the Gateway. A submission
        is defined as a dataset composed of one or more records pertinent to a
        specific reporting period. A submission should include all relevant
        records for the specified reporting period as defined in 3.3 BHSD

              respective month. This must be a date in the past. The Gateway
              will default the previous month as the Reporting Period, but the
              user may change as needed.
